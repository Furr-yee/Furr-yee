- Heya! I’m @Furr-yee
- I like first-person shooters and fighting games!
- As of now i currently am not taking any subjects but hopefully will around summertime when I go to my cyber patriots camp.
- I can't wait till I get a job next year, the reason being is because I want to at least grasp the concept of IT Fundamentals before I do anything advanced.
- My preferred method of communication is through discord so shoot out a friend request there if you will :3 "Furr-yee🐾#0115"
- I am a little lonely... but don't worry I still have a few online friends that keep me company and am grateful for all of them ヾ(＠⌒▽⌒＠)ﾉ
