- Heya! I’m @Furr-yee 
- I like First person shooters and fighting games! 
- As of now i'm currently not taking any subjects but hopefully will around summer time when i go to my cyber patriots camp. 
- I can't wait till i get a job next year, the reason being is because i want to at least grasp the concept of IT Fundementles before i do anything advance. 
- My preferd method of comunication is through discord so shoot out a friend request there if you will :3 "Furr-yee🐾#0115" 
- i am a little lonely... but don't worry i still have a few online friends that keep me company and am gratefull for all of them ヾ(＠⌒▽⌒＠)ﾉ
